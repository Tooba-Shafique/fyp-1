        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          What if you’ve been feeling awful for a while? You feel intensely tired, sad, and perhaps
          hopeless. You may be angry or disappointed in yourself or others. You may feel you no longer
          have control over your life. Yet, there is hope! Let's explore why.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-sky-700 mt-6">Understanding Depression</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Depression can arise from life events such as job loss, divorce, health issues, or emotional
          trauma. Stress, fatigue, and anxiety can intensify these feelings. Many people hide their
          emotions, which can make the situation worse over time.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-sky-700 mt-6">The Role of Self-Pity</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          If you feel stuck and overwhelmed, you may start developing self-pity. Depression often
          stems from how you perceive your situation. When sad circumstances create anger,
          frustration, and self-pity, depression can take hold.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-sky-700 mt-6">Talk About Your Depression</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          It can be challenging for family and friends to understand what you are going through.
          Depression not only affects you but also impacts those around you. Open communication
          is key—let them know how they can help.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-sky-700 mt-6">You Are Not Alone</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Around 1 in 5 people experience depression at some point in their lives. Seeking support
          is not a weakness—it is a step toward healing. Professional help or counseling can provide
          guidance when you feel overwhelmed.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-sky-700 mt-6">Supporting a Loved One</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          If your partner or friend is struggling with depression, take it seriously. Ask how you can help.
          Sometimes, just being there and listening can make a difference.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-sky-700 mt-6">Steps to a Positive Future</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Moving forward requires small steps. Let go of unrealistic expectations and rediscover
          your purpose. Every life has value—including yours.
